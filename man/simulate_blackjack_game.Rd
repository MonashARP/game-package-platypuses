\usage{
simulate_blackjack_game(num_players = 1, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_players}{Integer. Number of players in the game (default is 1).}

\item{seed}{Optional integer. If provided, sets the random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A structured list of class \code{"blackjack_game"} containing:
\describe{
\item{players}{A list of player results. Each contains the player's hand, final score, and outcome message.}
\item{dealer}{A list with the dealer's final hand and score.}
}
}
\description{
This function simulates a complete round of Blackjack between one or more players and a dealer.
Each player is dealt two cards and follows a simple decision strategy (e.g., hit on low scores).
The dealer plays according to standard rules, including hitting on soft 17.
}
\details{
Each player acts independently and uses a basic AI decision rule:
hit below 12, stand at 17+, and probabilistic decisions between 12â€“16.
The dealer continues hitting until reaching 17 or more, and hits on a soft 17.
