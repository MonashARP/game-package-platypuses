}

}
\value{

\description{
Randomly selects a specified number of cards from a given deck.
This function is typically used to deal the initial hand to a player or the dealer
in a round of Blackjack.
}
\details{
This function samples cards from a shuffled \code{card} vector. It does not remove dealt cards
from the original deck â€” if needed, you can manage deck state manually using indexing.
}

deck <- deck_cards()
hand <- deal_hand(deck$cards, 2)
print(hand)
