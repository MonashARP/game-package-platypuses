\title{Calculate the Score of a Blackjack Hand}
\usage{
blackjack_score(hand)
}
\arguments{
\item{hand}{A \code{card} vector representing the hand to be scored (e.g., \code{card(c("A","10"), c("♠","♦"))}).}
}
\value{
A numeric value between 2 and 31 representing the total score of the hand.
}
\description{
This function computes the total value of a Blackjack hand using a C++ backend for efficient scoring.
Aces are treated as 11 unless doing so causes the hand to bust, in which case they are treated as 1.
}
\details{
This function calls an underlying C++ function (\code{score_hand_cpp}) for performance.
It automatically adjusts Ace values and supports hands of any length.
}
\examples{
blackjack_score(card(c("A", "10"), c("♠", "♦")))       # returns 21
blackjack_score(card(c("A", "9", "2"), c("♠", "♣", "♦"))) # returns 12

}
