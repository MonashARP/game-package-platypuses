Description: The Blackjack package enables users to simulate rounds of the classic Blackjack game 
    and calculate the score of hands using standard rules. It includes functions to create shuffled 
    decks, deal cards, score player and dealer hands with proper handling of Aces, and simulate 
    full rounds with multiple players. The package also supports decision-making logic such as 
    hitting, standing, and handling soft 17 scenarios. Includes a vignette with gameplay examples.
